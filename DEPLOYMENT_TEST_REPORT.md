# Deployment Test Report

**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Test Tool:** Puppeteer
**Target:** https://workbench.lolzlab.com

## Executive Summary

The deployment is partially functional. The frontend loads correctly and the health endpoint responds, but there's a critical routing mismatch between the nginx configuration and backend API routes that prevents the chat functionality from working.

## Test Results

### ✅ Infrastructure Tests

| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Site Accessibility | ✅ PASS | Site loads at https://workbench.lolzlab.com |
| SSL/TLS | ✅ PASS | HTTPS redirect working, SSL termination by Cloudflare |
| Health Endpoint | ✅ PASS | `/api/health` returns 200 with service info |
| Frontend Loading | ✅ PASS | React app loads successfully |
| UI Components | ✅ PASS | Chat, Analytics tabs, search bar, message input present |

### ❌ Functionality Tests

| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Chat Creation | ❌ FAIL | 404 error on `/api/conversations` endpoint |
| Message Sending | ❌ FAIL | "Failed to create new conversation" error |
| API Routing | ❌ FAIL | Route mismatch between nginx and backend |

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Critical: API Route Mismatch**
- **Problem:** Nginx proxies `/api/*` to backend root `/`, but backend routes don't align
- **Impact:** All conversation and chat endpoints return 404
- **Evidence:**
  - Nginx: `/api/conversations` → Backend: `/conversations` (404)
  - Backend expects: `/conversations` directly
  - Frontend calls: `/api/conversations`

### 2. **Minor: HTTP 404 Alert**
- **Problem:** Persistent HTTP 404 alert shows on page load
- **Impact:** Poor user experience
- **Cause:** Initial API call failing

## Root Cause Analysis

The backend routes are configured without `/api` prefix:
- Backend: `/conversations`, `/chat/persistent`
- Nginx proxy: `/api/*` → `/`
- Frontend expects: `/api/conversations`, `/api/chat/persistent`

This creates a mismatch where:
1. Frontend makes request to `/api/conversations`
2. Nginx strips `/api/` and forwards to backend as `/conversations`
3. Backend doesn't have `/conversations` route (it has it under different mounting)

## Recommended Fixes

### Option 1: Update Backend Routes (Recommended)
Add `/api` prefix to all backend routes in `main.rs`:
```rust
.route("/api/conversations", ...)
.route("/api/chat/persistent", ...)
```

### Option 2: Update Nginx Configuration
Change nginx proxy configuration:
```nginx
location /api/conversations {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/conversations;
}
location /api/chat {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/chat;
}
```

### Option 3: Update Frontend API Calls
Modify frontend to call backend routes directly without `/api` prefix.

## Security Observations

✅ **Positive:**
- HTTPS enforced with proper redirect
- Security headers present (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- CORS properly configured
- JWT authentication in place

⚠️ **Considerations:**
- No authentication required for initial page load (by design?)
- Error messages could be more generic to avoid information disclosure

## Performance Observations

- Initial page load: Fast (< 1s)
- API response time: Good (health check < 200ms)
- No visible performance issues

## Browser Console Errors

```
Failed to create new conversation
HTTP 404 errors on API calls
```

## Test Environment

- Browser: Chrome (Headless via Puppeteer)
- Location: Same network as deployment
- Test Framework: Puppeteer v131.0.6778.204

## Conclusion

The deployment infrastructure is working correctly (nginx, systemd services, SSL/TLS), but the application is non-functional due to API routing issues. This is a configuration problem that can be fixed by aligning the route definitions between frontend, nginx, and backend.

**Deployment Status:** ❌ Not Production Ready

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix API route mismatch (Critical)
2. Test all endpoints after fix
3. Verify chat functionality works end-to-end
4. Remove or handle 404 alerts gracefully

## Screenshots

- Homepage loads successfully with UI components
- Error message: "Failed to create new conversation"
- HTTP 404 alert visible on page load
