### üö® [AUDIT-001] Authentication - Cookie Security Configuration - **COMPLETED**
**Completed by**: AUTH_SPECIALIST
**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Priority**: Critical (OWASP A05:2021 ‚Äì Security Misconfiguration)

**As a** security engineer
**I want to** implement environment-based cookie security configuration
**So that** session cookies are properly secured in production environments

**Acceptance Criteria:** ALL COMPLETED ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Enable secure flag for production deployments (replaced hardcoded secure: false)
- ‚úÖ Add SameSite=Strict for CSRF protection
- ‚úÖ Add configurable override via environment variables
- ‚úÖ Test cookie security in different environments
- ‚úÖ Write comprehensive tests for all security scenarios

**Security Implementation:**
- **Critical Vulnerability Fixed**: Removed hardcoded `with_secure(false)` from main.rs line 72
- **Environment-Based Security**: Automatic secure=true for production, secure=false for development
- **Override Capability**: COOKIE_SECURE environment variable for explicit control
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite=Strict configuration with Lax/None options
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Security configuration logging for audit trails

**Technical Architecture:**
- Created `CookieSecurityConfig` struct with secure, same_site, and environment fields
- Enhanced `AppConfig::from_env()` with cookie security logic and validation
- Updated `SessionManagerLayer` to use configuration instead of hardcoded values
- Added environment variable parsing with case-insensitive support
- Implemented fallback to secure defaults for invalid configurations

**Security Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Core environment variable - determines default secure flag
ENVIRONMENT=production          # secure=true by default
ENVIRONMENT=development         # secure=false by default

# Override variables for special configurations
COOKIE_SECURE=true             # Explicit override regardless of environment
COOKIE_SAME_SITE=Strict        # Options: Strict, Lax, None (default: Strict)
```

**Security Benefits:**
- **CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FIXED**: No hardcoded insecure cookie settings
- **Session Hijacking Prevention**: Secure flag prevents transmission over insecure connections
- **CSRF Attack Prevention**: SameSite=Strict prevents cross-site request forgery
- **Environment Awareness**: Automatic production security with development flexibility
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Override capability for special deployment scenarios

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/config.rs` - Added CookieSecurityConfig struct and environment parsing
- `backend/src/main.rs` - Updated SessionManagerLayer configuration with security settings
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all security scenarios and edge cases

**Testing Coverage:**
- Environment-based secure flag testing (development vs production)
- Explicit override functionality with COOKIE_SECURE variable
- Case-insensitive environment variable parsing
- SameSite configuration validation and fallback behavior
- Invalid configuration handling with secure defaults

**Security Verification:**
- Development environment: secure=false, SameSite=Strict (allows local development)
- Production environment: secure=true, SameSite=Strict (maximum security)
- Override testing: COOKIE_SECURE=true works regardless of environment
- Logging verification: Security configuration properly logged for audit trails

**OWASP Compliance:**
- Addresses A05:2021 ‚Äì Security Misconfiguration
- Eliminates hardcoded insecure cookie configuration
- Implements secure-by-default for production environments
- Provides proper CSRF protection with SameSite controls
- Enables security monitoring through configuration logging

**Production Impact:**
- **BEFORE**: Hardcoded secure=false exposed sessions to man-in-the-middle attacks
- **AFTER**: Environment-aware secure configuration with production defaults
- **Security Status**: Critical cookie security vulnerability RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**Migration Guide:**
```bash
# Production deployment (secure cookies enabled automatically)
export ENVIRONMENT=production

# Development (allows insecure cookies for localhost)
export ENVIRONMENT=development

# Special configurations (explicit override)
export COOKIE_SECURE=true
export COOKIE_SAME_SITE=Lax
```

**Rate Limiting Configuration:**
- Free users: Base limits (API: 100/hour, Upload: 10/hour)
- Premium users: 5x multiplier (API: 500/hour, Upload: 50/hour)
- Admin users: 10x multiplier + optional override bypass
- Circuit breaker: 5 failures trigger 60-second timeout

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/middleware/rate_limit.rs` - Added circuit breaker and in-memory fallback
- `backend/src/main.rs` - Re-enabled rate limiting middleware at lines 19, 263-266

- Rate limit service fallback from Redis to in-memory
- User tier multipliers and admin overrides
- Rate limit headers in HTTP responses

**OWASP Compliance:**
- Addresses A04:2021 ‚Äì Insecure Design by implementing proper rate limiting controls

- Maintained working directory `/mnt/datadrive_m2/research_workbench` for proper project context

**Problem Solved:**
- Original issue: "Invalid API key" errors due to Claude CLI binary not being found in subprocess PATH
- Root cause: Subprocess environment didn't inherit PATH properly for Claude CLI location
- Solution: Use absolute path to Claude CLI binary and inherit all necessary environment variables

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/llm/claude_code.rs` - Fixed subprocess execution at line 86

**Testing Results:**
- All 22 backend tests pass successfully
- Some tests ignored (related to embedding and search functionality not currently needed)
- No regressions introduced by the fix
