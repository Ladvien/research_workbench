## Phase 1: Core Chat Functionality

###  1.2 OpenAI Integration - **COMPLETED**
**Completed by**: Agent-2
**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Commit**: 4aaf084

**As a** user
**I want to** receive AI responses to my messages
**So that** I can have meaningful conversations

**Acceptance Criteria:**  ALL COMPLETED
-  Backend connects to OpenAI API
-  Messages are sent to GPT-4 model (configurable)
-  Responses are returned and displayed via JSON API
-  Error states are handled gracefully with proper HTTP codes
-  Loading state supported through async endpoint design
-  Environment variable configuration implemented

**Technical Implementation:**
-  Set up Axum 0.7+ backend with basic routing
-  Integrated async-openai client with error handling
-  Created `/api/chat` endpoint with comprehensive request/response handling
-  Implemented structured error handling middleware with AppError types
-  Added environment variable configuration (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, etc.)
-  Production-ready logging with tracing
-  CORS and security middleware configured
-  Health check endpoint at `/health`

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/chat` - Send chat completion requests to OpenAI
- `GET /health` - Service health monitoring

**Architecture Components:**
- `backend/src/config.rs` - Configuration management
- `backend/src/error.rs` - Custom error types and HTTP response mapping
- `backend/src/openai.rs` - OpenAI client service and data models
- `backend/src/handlers/chat.rs` - HTTP handlers for chat functionality
- `backend/src/handlers/health.rs` - Health check endpoint

**Ready for Integration:**
- Frontend (Agent-1) can connect to `/api/chat` endpoint
- Database persistence (Agent-3) can be integrated without affecting core functionality
