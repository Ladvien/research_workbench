- ✅ Added react-markdown with syntax highlighting using react-syntax-highlighter
- ✅ Created message component with role-based styling (user/assistant/system)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 27 passing tests across all components

**Architecture Components:**
- `frontend/src/components/Chat.tsx` - Main chat interface with header, message area, and input
- `frontend/src/components/Message.tsx` - Message component with role-based styling and markdown rendering
- `frontend/src/components/ChatInput.tsx` - Input component with form handling and keyboard shortcuts
- `frontend/src/types/chat.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for chat data structures
- `frontend/tests/` - Comprehensive test suite covering all components and functionality
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration for responsive design
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Vite build configuration with testing setup

**Features Implemented:**
- Responsive chat interface with clean, modern design
- Role-based message styling (user messages right-aligned, assistant/system left-aligned)
- Full markdown support including headers, bold, italic, links, lists
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks with multiple language support
- Auto-scrolling to newest messages
- Loading states with animated thinking indicator
- Form validation and proper keyboard handling (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line)
- Error handling UI (ready for integration with backend)
- Mobile-first responsive design that works on all screen sizes

**Integration Ready:**
- Compatible with OpenAI integration (Agent-2) through API endpoints
- Ready for message persistence (Agent-3) through conversation state management
- All UI components tested and verified working

###  1.2 OpenAI Integration - **COMPLETED**
**Completed by**: Agent-2
**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Commit**: 4aaf084

**As a** user
**I want to** receive AI responses to my messages
**So that** I can have meaningful conversations

**Acceptance Criteria:**  ALL COMPLETED
-  Backend connects to OpenAI API
-  Messages are sent to GPT-4 model (configurable)
-  Responses are returned and displayed via JSON API
-  Error states are handled gracefully with proper HTTP codes
-  Loading state supported through async endpoint design
-  Environment variable configuration implemented

**Technical Implementation:**
-  Set up Axum 0.7+ backend with basic routing
-  Integrated async-openai client with error handling
-  Created `/api/chat` endpoint with comprehensive request/response handling
-  Implemented structured error handling middleware with AppError types
-  Added environment variable configuration (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, etc.)
-  Production-ready logging with tracing
-  CORS and security middleware configured
-  Health check endpoint at `/health`

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/chat` - Send chat completion requests to OpenAI
- `GET /health` - Service health monitoring

**Architecture Components:**
- `backend/src/config.rs` - Configuration management
- `backend/src/error.rs` - Custom error types and HTTP response mapping
- `backend/src/openai.rs` - OpenAI client service and data models
- `backend/src/handlers/chat.rs` - HTTP handlers for chat functionality
- `backend/src/handlers/health.rs` - Health check endpoint

**Ready for Integration:**
- Frontend (Agent-1) can connect to `/api/chat` endpoint
- Database persistence (Agent-3) can be integrated without affecting core functionality

### 1.3 Message Persistence - **COMPLETED**
**Completed by**: Agent-3
**Date**: 2025-09-14

**As a** user
**I want to** have my conversations saved
**So that** I can continue them later

**Acceptance Criteria:** ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ Messages are saved to PostgreSQL
- ✅ Conversations persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Database schema supports conversations and messages
- ✅ Timestamps are recorded for all messages
- ✅ Token usage is tracked per message

**Technical Implementation:**
- ✅ Set up PostgreSQL 17 connection with sqlx and automatic migrations
- ✅ Created initial database migrations matching ARCHITECTURE.md schema
- ✅ Implemented message repository pattern with separate repos for users, conversations, and messages
- ✅ Added conversation ID to frontend state management with Zustand
- ✅ Created comprehensive data access layer (DAL) with business logic services
- ✅ Built RESTful API endpoints for conversation and message management
- ✅ Implemented conversation branching support for future threading features
- ✅ Added comprehensive test suite for database operations
- ✅ Created TypeScript interfaces and API client for frontend integration

**Database Schema:**
- `users` table with Argon2 password hashing
- `conversations` table with user relationships and metadata
- `messages` table with branching support (parent_id for threading)
- `message_embeddings` table (prepared for semantic search)
- `attachments` table (prepared for file upload features)
- `api_usage` table for token tracking and analytics

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET/POST /api/conversations` - List/create conversations
- `GET/DELETE/PATCH /api/conversations/:id` - Manage conversations
- `GET/POST /api/conversations/:id/messages` - List/send messages
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages/:parent_id/branch` - Create message branches
