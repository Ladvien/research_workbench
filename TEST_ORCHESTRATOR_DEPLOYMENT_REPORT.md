## CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### üî¥ PRIORITY 1 (FIX TODAY)
1. **Frontend Store Mocking Crisis**
   - **Issue:** useConversationStore mocking failures
   - **Impact:** 50%+ frontend test failure rate
   - **Location:** ConversationSidebar.test.tsx and related tests
   - **Solution Required:** Implement proper Zustand store mocking

2. **Backend Database Interface Mismatch**
   - **Issue:** Tests expecting Database::from_env() method
   - **Impact:** Integration test failures
   - **Location:** conversation_endpoint_tests.rs
   - **Solution Required:** Update test setup to match current API

3. **Component Test Performance**
   - **Issue:** BranchingChat tests timing out (15+ seconds)
   - **Impact:** CI/CD pipeline delays
   - **Location:** BranchingChat.test.tsx
   - **Solution Required:** Optimize test setup and mocking

### üü° PRIORITY 2 (FIX THIS WEEK)
1. **Backend Compilation Warnings** - 39 warnings affecting build quality
2. **Missing Test Infrastructure** - setup_test_app() function needed
3. **Hook Dependency Arrays** - Multiple useEffect dependency issues
4. **Test Performance Optimization** - Reduce overall test execution time
