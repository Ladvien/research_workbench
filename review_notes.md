## 🎯 Prioritized Action Plan

### Week 1 - Critical Security & Infrastructure
1. Fix cookie security configuration (AUDIT-001)
2. Remove hardcoded JWT secret (AUDIT-002)
3. Update database pool to 100 connections
4. Standardize error handling patterns

### Week 2 - High Priority Security & Performance
1. Re-enable rate limiting with fallback (AUDIT-003)
2. Strengthen password requirements (AUDIT-004)
3. Eliminate string cloning in hot paths
4. Add missing database indexes

### Week 3 - API & Architecture
1. Implement API versioning (/api/v1/)
2. Standardize error response formats
3. Fix transaction boundaries
4. Add connection pool monitoring

### Week 4 - Testing Foundation
1. Set up test infrastructure
2. Add authentication integration tests
3. Add database repository tests
4. Add API endpoint tests

### Weeks 5-8 - Comprehensive Testing
1. Achieve 80% test coverage minimum
2. Add performance benchmarks
3. Add security test suite
4. Add E2E test scenarios

## 🔄 Next Review Cycle

**Scheduled:** After Week 4 completion
**Focus Areas:**
1. Verify critical security fixes
2. Validate performance improvements
3. Review test coverage progress
4. Assess production readiness

## Team Assignments

- **Security Team:** Own AUDIT-001 through AUDIT-006
- **Architecture Team:** Own database pool and error handling
- **Performance Team:** Own optimization roadmap implementation
- **Testing Team:** Own test coverage improvement
- **API Team:** Own versioning and standardization
- **Database Team:** Own index creation and query optimization

---

**Overall Assessment:** The backend has solid architectural foundations but requires significant work before production deployment. Critical security vulnerabilities and lack of testing are the primary blockers. With focused effort over 4-8 weeks, the system can achieve production readiness.
