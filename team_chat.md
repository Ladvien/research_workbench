### 2025-09-14 - Agent-2 - Story 1.2 OpenAI Integration COMPLETED

Successfully implemented OpenAI integration backend with the following achievements:

**Core Implementation:**
- ✅ Axum 0.7+ web framework with async/await
- ✅ async-openai client integration with GPT-4 support
- ✅ `/api/chat` endpoint for chat completions
- ✅ `/health` endpoint for service monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with custom AppError types
- ✅ Environment variable configuration (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
- ✅ Structured logging with tracing
- ✅ CORS and middleware setup

**Architecture Components:**
- `src/config.rs` - Environment configuration management
- `src/error.rs` - Custom error types with HTTP response mapping
- `src/openai.rs` - OpenAI client service and data models
- `src/handlers/chat.rs` - HTTP handlers for chat endpoints
- `src/handlers/health.rs` - Health check endpoint

**API Endpoints Ready:**
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `POST /api/chat` - Send messages to OpenAI and get responses

**Integration Notes for Other Agents:**
- The OpenAI service is designed to work standalone or with database layer
- Environment variables configured in .env file (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, etc.)
- Error handling is production-ready with proper HTTP status codes
- All acceptance criteria for Story 1.2 have been met

**Next Steps:**
- Agent-1: Frontend can now integrate with `/api/chat` endpoint
- Agent-3: Database persistence layer can be added without affecting core OpenAI functionality
- Ready for testing and deployment once frontend is complete
