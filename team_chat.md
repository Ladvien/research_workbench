### 2025-09-14 - Agent-2 - Story 1.2 OpenAI Integration COMPLETED

Successfully implemented OpenAI integration backend with the following achievements:

**Core Implementation:**
- ✅ Axum 0.7+ web framework with async/await
- ✅ async-openai client integration with GPT-4 support
- ✅ `/api/chat` endpoint for chat completions
- ✅ `/health` endpoint for service monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with custom AppError types
- ✅ Environment variable configuration (OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
- ✅ Structured logging with tracing
- ✅ CORS and middleware setup

**Architecture Components:**
- `src/config.rs` - Environment configuration management
- `src/error.rs` - Custom error types with HTTP response mapping
- `src/openai.rs` - OpenAI client service and data models
- `src/handlers/chat.rs` - HTTP handlers for chat endpoints
- `src/handlers/health.rs` - Health check endpoint

**API Endpoints Ready:**
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `POST /api/chat` - Send messages to OpenAI and get responses

**Integration Notes for Other Agents:**
- The OpenAI service is designed to work standalone or with database layer
- Environment variables configured in .env file (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, etc.)
- Error handling is production-ready with proper HTTP status codes
- All acceptance criteria for Story 1.2 have been met

**Next Steps:**
- Agent-1: Frontend can now integrate with `/api/chat` endpoint
- Agent-3: Database persistence layer can be added without affecting core OpenAI functionality
- Ready for testing and deployment once frontend is complete

### 2025-09-14 - Agent-3 - Story 1.3 Message Persistence COMPLETED

Successfully implemented comprehensive message persistence with PostgreSQL backend:

**Core Implementation:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL 17 connection with sqlx and automatic migrations
- ✅ Complete database schema matching ARCHITECTURE.md specifications
- ✅ Repository pattern for users, conversations, and messages
- ✅ Data Access Layer (DAL) with business logic services
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints for conversation and message management
- ✅ Conversation branching support for future threading features
- ✅ Frontend TypeScript interfaces and Zustand state management
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for database operations

**Database Schema:**
- `users` table with Argon2 password hashing
- `conversations` table with user relationships and metadata
- `messages` table with branching support (parent_id)
- `message_embeddings` table (ready for semantic search)
- `attachments` table (ready for file upload features)
- `api_usage` table for token tracking

**API Endpoints Ready:**
- `GET/POST /api/conversations` - List/create conversations
- `GET/DELETE/PATCH /api/conversations/:id` - Manage conversations
- `GET/POST /api/conversations/:id/messages` - List/send messages
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages/:parent_id/branch` - Create message branches

**Integration Notes for Other Agents:**
- Database migrations run automatically on startup
- Repository pattern allows easy extension for new features
- State management ready for frontend integration
- Token tracking prepared for usage analytics
- All acceptance criteria for Story 1.3 have been met

**Ready for Integration:**
- Agent-1: Frontend components can now persist conversations across sessions
- OpenAI responses can be saved to database via message repository
- Conversation management UI can leverage the new API endpoints
